 Key Learnings  

- Always verify email domain before trusting requests.
- Header analysis can reveal inconsistencies in IPs, `Reply-To`, and `Return-Path`.
- Hovering over links helps detect mismatched/malicious URLs.
- Many phishing emails use fear and urgency to manipulate users.
- Grammar and spelling errors are often clear signs of phishing.

 Conclusion  

This exercise demonstrated how cyber attackers craft phishing emails to exploit user trust. By carefully analyzing sender identity, headers, links, and language, we can detect and avoid falling for such traps. These skills are critical for cyber defense and awareness.
